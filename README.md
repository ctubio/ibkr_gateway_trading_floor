### Prerequisites

- `x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++`
- `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc`
- `x86_64-w64-mingw32-ar`
- `x86_64-w64-mingw32-ranlib`

```

### Output

### Internal Dependencies

The build process bundles several internal components:

- `lib/protobuf/` — Protobuf and Abseil C++ support
- `lib/IntelRDFPMathLib20U4/` — precise decimal arithmetic

## Architecture

The executable is assembled from:

```
src/main.cpp         # app entry point and window initialization
src/api/gateway.h    # TradingAPI interface, IBKR connection logic
src/gui/*.h          # window modules and UI handling
src/api/shared.h     # shared helpers, registry, dark mode, process helpers
src/api/registry.h   # registry-backed settings
src/api/sound.h      # audio notification queue
```

## Usage

- Use the tray icon to show/hide the main dashboard.
- Open windows for account, positions, orders, market quotes, news, and Time & Sales.

## Troubleshooting

- If the app cannot locate `ibgateway.exe`, it will prompt you to select the path.
- If IB Gateway is not running, enable Auto-start Gateway or start it manually.
- Use the Debug Log to inspect connection, market data, and news events.
- Delete the registry root to reset preferences:

```
Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ibkr-gateway-trading-floor
```
