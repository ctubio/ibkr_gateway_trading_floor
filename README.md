A lightweight Windows tray application that connects to Interactive Brokers Gateway and surfaces live account, market, and trading data in a compact, portable Windows GUI.

> System Tray Icon: 💼

## Overview

This application is a modern desktop trading companion built on the Interactive Brokers C++ API. It is designed to work with **IBKR Gateway** (not Trader Workstation) and provides a modular, multi-window environment for professional traders.

### Core Capabilities:
- **Real-time Market Data**: Live quotes, tick-by-tick Market, and symbol watchlists.
- **Account Intelligence**: Live margin metrics, Net Liquidation Value with optional Text-to-Speech (TTS) alerts, and detailed P&L analytics.
- **Portfolio Management**: Comprehensive position tracking with dividend data and 52-week range analysis.
- **Order Execution Tracking**: Real-time order status monitoring with intuitive color-coding and in-place modifications.
- **Information Hub**: Symbol-specific news headlines with provider filtering, HTML-to-RTF article preview, and a centralized watchlist manager.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Font zoom support for ListViews, split-panel Market, and auto-complete symbol entry in Watchlist.
- **Robust Infrastructure**: Auto-reconnecting watchdog, persistent registry-based settings, and a system-tray-first design.

## Key Highlights

- **Tray-Centric Design**: Runs primarily from the system tray with dynamic status icons (Connected/Disconnected) and a context menu for quick window management.
- **Auto-Connect Watchdog**: A dedicated background timer monitors the connection to `127.0.0.1:4001` and automatically restores the session if the Gateway drops.
- **Modular Window Architecture**: A "Trading Floor" layout where 10+ independent windows (Dashboard, Coins, Diamonds, Orders, Watchlist, News, Market, Settings, Debug Log) can be arranged, persisted, and restored.
- **Advanced Watchlists**: Create and manage named symbol lists directly in the Watchlist window, which are then shared across News and Market.
- **Accessibility & Alerts**: Integrated Windows SAPI for NetLiq voice alerts and custom sound notifications for critical trading events.
- **Visual Customization**: Full Dark Mode support, list view font zooming, and high-contrast color-coding for P&L and order statuses.

## Requirements

### Software

- Windows 10 or 11 (x86_64)
- IBKR Gateway

## Configuration

All app settings and state are stored under:

```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ibkr-gateway-trading-floor
```

The application does not create any configuration files in the filesystem; it stores its settings only in the Windows Registry.

Saved state includes:

- window size/position
- watchlist definitions

## Architecture

The executable is assembled from:

```
src/main.cpp         # app entry point and window initialization
src/api/gateway.h    # TradingAPI interface, IBKR connection logic
src/gui/*.h          # window modules and UI handling
src/api/shared.h     # shared helpers, registry, dark mode, process helpers
src/api/registry.h   # registry-backed settings
